//  (っ˘▽˘)っ Week 2: The Analytics Competencies and the Professional Maturity Model ⊂(◕.◕⊂)
//====================================================================================

- 2.1 Introduction
	- 2.1.1 Overview
			Math. Statistics. ETL. Data Security. Visualization. Programming. Methods and Algorithms. Domain. Research Methods. Ethics.
			
			This list of skills and competencies needed to perform the various Analytics functions appear to be endless and daunting. Does one really need to have all these skills to do Analytics? If so, then Analytics professionals are indeed unicorns.
			
			In truth, depending on one’s role in an Analytics team, the expected competency level per skill varies. This is where the Professional Maturity Model helps.
	- 2.1.2 Learning Objectives
			At the end of this week, you will be able to chart a learning and development plan for yourself by knowing the various Analytics competencies and the required proficiency level per competency for the Analytics role you are pursuing, and by assessing yourself using the Professional Maturity Model.
			
-  2.2 Analytics Skills and Competencies
	- 2.2.1 Watch: APEC Project DARE
			After coming up with a baseline definition of Analytics and
			a set of the major Analytics job families, we now move on
			to identify a list of Analytics skills and competencies that
			will be needed by Analytics professionals to perform their roles.
			
			As the Analytics Association of the Philippines has set out
			to have a framework that will be, among others, comprehensive (but not complicated), enduring,
			and valuable to professionals and organizations,
			the framework had to ensure that these competencies are
			globally recognized.
			
			Having a globally recognized list means that Filipino professionals and organizations who
			will adapt these competencies can be globally competitive
			as well.
			
			This is where APEC Project DARE comes in.
			Project DARE (or Data Analytics Raising Employment) is an
			initiative of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (or
			APEC) led by the United States Department of Labor with
			co-sponsorship from the governments of Australia, Japan,
			Malaysia, Peru, Chinese Taipei, and Viet Nam and endorsed
			by the APEC Business Advisory Council.
			
			As a project of APEC’s Human Resources and Development
			Working Group, Project DARE seeks to facilitate development of a data analytics-enabled workforce
			across the APEC region to effectively support sustainable
			economic growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.
			In May 2017, a 50-person Advisory Group composed of 14
			APEC member economies, co-chaired by the global skills
			and knowledge company Wiley and the Business Higher
			Education Forum (or BHEF), met in Singapore to develop
			this set of Analytics competencies.
			
			With guidance from North America’s BHEF and Europe’s
			Project EDISON, the Advisory Group was able to marry the
			skills and expected competencies from North America and
			Europe with the requirements and expectations from the
			APEC region to come up with a globally recognized list of
			Analytics skills and competencies.

			APEC Data Science and Analytics (DSA) Competencies
			
	- 2.2.2 Watch: The Recommended APEC Analytics Competencies
			
			The following 10 competencies apply to teams comprising
			not only of data engineers and data scientists but also to a
			new emerging segment of Analytics-enabled professionals
			including data stewards, functional analysts, and analytics
			managers.
			
			The first 4 competencies comprise the Business and
			Organization skills:
			1. Domain Knowledge & Application
			2. Data Management & Governance
			3. Operational Analytics
			4. Data Visualization & Presentation 
			
			The next 5 competencies comprise the Technical
			skills: 
			1. Research Methods

			It can also be used by other stakeholders to build
			their own solutions for educating, training, certifying,
			recruiting, managing, and otherwise supporting Analytics
			and Analytics-enabled professionals.
			
			As I introduce you to each of these competencies, do a self-
			assessment of your skill level.
			
			This will help you craft a training and development plan for yourself.
			And do not worry if you don’t have the skills right
			now.
			
			Acquiring these skills is one of the reasons you are here
			anyway, right?
			
	- 2.2.3 Watch: Business and Organization Skills

	- 2.2.4 Watch: Technical Skills

			Let’s move on to the Technical Skills.
			Do a self-assessment as we go along.
			
			These are the skills that you may really not have any proficiency on at this time.
			Again, do not worry, we’ll build up these skills in due time.
			
			With Research Methods, you utilize the scientific and
			engineering methods to discover and create new
			Used by Data Scientists, research methods are the
			strategies, processes or techniques utilized in the collection
			of data or evidence for analysis in order to uncover new
			information or create better understanding of a topic.

			At which level are you in right now?
			
			With Data Analytics Methods & Algorithms, you
			implement and evaluate machine learning methods and
			algorithms on the data to derive insights for decision-
			making.
			This is, again, the area of Data Scientists.
			With what they know of their data, they should now be able
			to identify the most appropriate methods or algorithm to really
			extract insights from data.
			This is moving towards real advanced Analytics as this competency starts where
			Statistical Technique ends.
			See Level 3 of Statistical Techniques and note where Methods & Algorithms start at Level 1.
			- Level 0. You currently don’t have the skill.

			At which level are you in right now?
			
			With Computing, you apply information technology, computational thinking, and utilize programming
			languages and software and hardware solutions for data
			analysis.
			This is software programming.
			Data Engineers and Data Scientists would have to develop these skills
			to perform their functions.
			You will learn several of these programming languages in Project SPARTA.
			- Level 0. You currently don’t have the skill.
			- Level 1. You perform basic data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
			- Level 2. You apply computational thinking to transform formal data models and process algorithms into program code.

			These are competencies that comprise the Technical skills:
			1. Research Methods
			2. Data Engineering Principles
			3. Statistical Techniques 
			4. Data Analytics Methods & Algorithms
			5. Computing 
			
			Exciting stuff, right?
			
			As you will see later, depending on the Analytics role that
			you will build a career on, you would need only certain
			Technical competencies to effective

	- 2.2.5 Watch: Workplace Skills
			
			Let’s move on to the last set of skills, the 21st Century
			Workplace Skills.
			
			With the 21 st Century Skills, there’s really no 3-level toolkit
			that can be applied given that these are necessary skills not
			only in Analytics but also in other fields as well.
			
			For Analytics, APEC Project DARE recommended that
			Analytics professionals should exhibit crosscutting skills
			essential for Analytics at all levels, including but not limited
			to: 
			1. collaboration
			2. communication and storytelling
			3. ethical mindset
			4. organizational awareness
			5. critical thinking
			6. planning and organizing
			7. problem solving
			8. decision making
			9. customer focus
			10. flexibility
			11. business fundamentals
			12. cross-cultural awareness
			13. social and societal awareness
			14. dynamic (self)re-skilling
			15. professional networking
			16. and entrepreneurship
			
			Such skills should be enabled at levels of proficiency driven behind successful career
			and professional development programs:
			1. Critical Thinking: Demonstrating the ability to apply critical thinking skills to solve problems and make effective decisions
			2. Communication: Understanding and communicating ideas 
			3. Collaboration: Working with others, appreciation of multicultural differences
			4. Creativity and Attitude: Deliver high quality work and focus on final result, initiative, intellectual risk
			5. Planning & Organizing: Planning and prioritizing work to manage time effectively and accomplish assigned tasks 
			6. Business Fundamentals: Having fundamental knowledge of the organization and the industry
			7. Customer Focus: Actively look for ways to identify market demands and meet customer or client needs
			8. Working with Tools & Technology: Selecting, using, and maintaining tools and technology to facilitate work activity
			9. Dynamic (Self-) Re-Skilling: Continuously monitor individual knowledge and skills as shared responsibility between employer and employee, ability to adopt to changes 
			10. Professional Network: Involvement and contribution to professional network activities
			11. Ethics: Adhere to high ethical and professional norms, responsible use of power data driven technologies, avoid and disregard un-ethical use of technologies and biased data collection and presentation
			
			Many actually call these skills soft skills but there’s really
			nothing “soft” about these skills.
			
			These skills are harder to develop as they take the longest time and
			is further influenced by the culture and the environment
			that an individual is exposed to.
			
-  2.3 The Professional Maturity Model
	- 2.3.1 Watch: The AAP Professional Maturity Model
			
			With a shared definition of Analytics, a set of the major
			Analytics job families, and a globally recognized list of
			Analytics skills and competencies, the Analytics Association
			of the Philippines introduces the AAP Professional Maturity
			Model.
			
			This model suggests a maximum proficiency level per
			competency and role.
			
			Roles requiring business and industry knowledge, i.e., data stewards and functional
			analysts, would require higher proficiency in the business
			and organizational skills.
			
			Roles requiring technical competencies, i.e., data engineers and data
			scientists, would require higher proficiency in the technical
			skills.
			
			Analytics managers should have high proficiency in
			business and industry skills as well as entry-level proficiency in the technical skills to effectively
			manage Analytics projects.
			
			All roles, however, are expected to have high proficiency in the 21st century skills.
			Take a look again at your self-assessment.
			How close are they to the expected proficiency levels of
			the Analytics role you are eyeing to be?
			Plan your training and development, as well as your work experiences, around the
			competencies that you need to build proficiency on.
			
	- 2.3.2 Watch: An Invitation for Collaboration
			
			Some notes about the AAP Professional Maturity Model:
			
			First, The 3-level toolkit presented this week is but a subset
			of a larger pool of proficiency expectations per level, per
			competency.
			
			It is important to highlight that the courses you will take within Project SPARTA are aligned
			to this 3- level toolkit and to the AAP Professional
			Maturity Model.
			
			Second, the model can be used not only by Analytics
			professionals to chart their career paths.
			
			It can also be used by other stakeholders to build their
			own solutions for educating, training, certifying, recruiting,
			managing, and otherwise supporting Analytics and Analytics-enabled
			professionals.
			
			Lastly, the Analytics Association of the Philippines invites
			everyone, from the private sector, to the academe, to
			government agencies to further develop and enhance the
			AAP Professional Maturity Model through the adoption
			and the evaluation of this framework.
			
			This course is just a start to introduce a set of standards in building
			world-class Filipino Analytics professionals.
			
			It must evolve, however, to keep pace with the advancement of Analytics
			and other emerging Analytics-enabled disciplines.
			
			Visit www.aap.ph to know more about how you can start
			being involved.

-  2.5 In a Nutshell
	- 2.5.1 Watch: Summary

			That’s all for Week 2: The Analytics Competencies and the
			Professional Maturity Model.
			
			Here are our key take-away points from this week:
			
			Analytics is a broad field of knowledge requiring
			quantitative and technical skills, industry expertise,
			and business acumen; but practitioners also need to
			be able to communicate effectively, build relationships, and coach others.
			
			Different roles call for different levels of proficiency
			across the various Analytics competencies.
			The AAP Professional Maturity Model is a framework
			that can help practitioners chart a career path for
			themselves.
			
			The Professional Maturity Model is a framework that
			will be in continuous improvement to keep up with
			the advancement of Analytics and other emerging Analytics-enabled disciplines.
			Practitioners are encouraged to contribute to its continuous
			improvement.
			
			In Week 3, we will be discussing the Organizational Maturity Model.
			As you have competencies to develop for you to perform your Analytics roles, so do
			organizations have “competencies” as well to develop
			to become data- driven organizations.
			
			We will tackle this in the next week.
			Thank you for completing Week 2 and see you in Week 3!
