- 1.3 Coming to a Common Definition of Analytics
	- 1.3.1 Watch: Data Value Chain

			To come to a shared definition of Analytics, let’s start with the data value chain.
			
			Data has been called a lot of things – a new natural resource, the new oil, the new water and so on and so forth.
			Being so, data then has to be mined and refined to extract the value from it. Analytics enables this transformation.
			And it starts, of course, with the creation of data. At this stage, data is created and generated from its source,
			mostly, from us: personal biodata, an employment application form, a bank loan application form, our medical records.
			When we buy something either from a physical store or an online store, when we call or text someone, when we take a photo, when we create videos, when we post something on Facebook or on Twitter, we create data.
			Machines and equipment can also create data: biometric machines, CCTVs, barcode scanners in retail stores, our phones, our computers. 
			This is the birth of data.
			
			All of these are collected by various people and organizations, stored into their applications, waiting to be extracted for the value that they will provide.
			The first transformation that data goes through is when it is extracted from these various sources and consolidated into a single repository.
			In this process, data is cleaned, categorized, transformed, aggregated, and loaded into a single repository where similar data from the past was also stored.
			At this stage, data is transformed into information.
			
			At this stage as well, organizations will be able to answer the question, “What happened?”
			The second transformation that data goes through is when information is transformed to insights.
			
			At this stage, since our single data repository also contains historical information, organizations can now see if there are trends or patterns that will emerge from all the stored information.
			From these trends and patterns, organizations will now be able to answer the questions,
			“Why did it happen?”
			“What could likely happen next?”
			
			The value of data will not be fully realized until organizations act on the insights that emerge from the analysis that has been done so far.
			The transformation then of insights to imperatives or actionable insights is the last transformation that data goes through.
			Given the insights of what could likely happen next, Analytics can develop various options that will help organizations answer the question, “What should be done next?”
			
			From these options, organizations can decide on a course of action for their organization.
			This is the data value chain: from the birth of data, to information (answering the question, “What happened?”), to insights (answering the questions, “Why did it happen?
			What could likely happen next?”), to imperatives or actionable insights (answering the question, “What should be done next?”).

	- 1.3.2 Watch: Data Value in Retail - An Example
			Let us look into an example on how the data value chain is
			realized.
			
			Supermarkets, department stores, online stores, even our
			suking sari-sari store all perform Analytics and allow data
			to move up its value chain.
			
			Whenever and wherever we go shopping, data about our
			purchase is recorded: date and time, location, the item
			bought, any discount, total cost, and, at times, our data as
			a customer.
			
			All these are collected on the cash register, or
			on an ecommerce site, or in Aling Maria’s notebook.
			This is the data stage.
			
			At the end of the day, the shop owner would want to
			know, “What happened?
			How much sales did they make?”
			Consolidating all the day’s sales would answer these
			questions.
			
			As the shop owner would also have the information from previous days or months,
			he or she might also notice that the sales for the day is
			quite less from previous days.
			
			This is also a piece of information that the data could tell the shop owner.
			This is the information stage.
			The shop owner would then naturally ask, “Why did it
			happen?”
			
			The shop owner would want to know what caused the dip in sales and if there’s any
			indication that it might continue in the future, the question,
			“What could likely happen next?”
			
			Looking at historical data, the shop owner might potentially see that the dip in
			sales always occur in the same period of the year.
			Further investigation could show that there are certain products
			stocked in their inventory that have really low sales during
			this time of the year.
			
			These are insights that a shop owner can deduce from the historical information.
			This is the insights stage.
			
			Finally, now knowing what caused the dip in sales and that
			there appears to be a pattern every year on the same
			period, the shop owner will ask, “What should be done
			next?”
			
			Knowing what products would sell more at given times of the year, the shop owner can then
			take action on the insights that were derived.
			This is the imperatives stage.
			
			With new actions taken to improve their business, the shop
			owner goes into a new cycle of the data value chain.
			
	- 1.3.3 Watch: Common Analytics Terminologies
			
			From the data value chain, certain Analytics disciplines
			emerge.
			
			These are Analytics terminologies that you may
			have already heard of.
			
			Normally associated with Data are Data Governance, Data
			Management, Data Security, and Data Ethics.
			
			These are disciplines that call for deep knowledge about
			what data is being collected, how it is being collected,
			how it is used, who has access to it, among others.
			
			With new government regulations on data handling, organizations
			are being mandated to tighten the performance of these
			activities.
			
			Associated with Information are terms such as Data
			Engineering, Data Warehousing, Data Architecture, Business Intelligence.
			And since this stage answers the question, “What happened?”, this is where
			Descriptive Analytics is also done.
			
			With Insights, as we answer the questions, “Why did it
			happen?
			
			What could likely happen next?”, this is where
			encounter terminologies such as Data Mining, Algorithms,
			Machine Learning.
			This is also where we do Diagnostic Analytics and Predictive Analytics.
			
			Finally, with Imperatives, we answer the question, “What
			should be done next?”, this is where we encounter
			terminologies such as Optimization, Simulation, Recommendation Engines.
			This is also where we do Prescriptive Analytics.
			Confused?
			Overwhelmed?
			That’s ok.
			
			We’ll get to learn more of these Analytics disciplines in the
			next module and in the other courses of Project SPARTA.
			
	- 1.3.4 Watch: The Major Analytics Job Families
			As Analytics transforms data to information to insights to
			imperatives through the value chain, we now find the
			major roles in Analytics.
			
			Data Stewards develop, enforce, and maintain an
			organization’s data governance process, data usage, and data security policies to
			ensure that data assets provide the organization with high-quality data.
			Their expertise is in business and industry domains.
			
			Data Stewards are the data gatekeepers of an organization.
			You won’t be able to get data without going through them.
			As they also ensure data quality, they will be the most
			knowledgeable in determining how to deal with missing or
			fix unclean data.
			Related job titles include data privacy officer, data security
			officer, data governance manager, data curator, data
			librarian.
			
			Data Engineers design, construct, test, and maintain data
			infrastructures including applications that extract, clean,
			transform, and load data from the data sources to
			centralized data repositories.
			Their expertise is in information technology, information science,
			and computer science.
			
			Ensuring that data from the centralized data repositories
			are in-sync with the various data sources is the
			responsibility of the Data Engineers.
			Furthermore, they are also responsible to make sure that the data
			infrastructures are available to key stakeholders during agreed
			times.
			Related job titles include ETL developer, data architect,
			data warehousing professional, big data engineer.
			
			Data Scientists leverage statistical techniques and create
			analytical models to derive new insights from quantitative
			and qualitative data.
			Their expertise is in mathematics and statistics.
			Data Scientists have keen eyes to find trends and patterns
			from current and historical pieces of information.
			This allows Data Scientists to make predictions
			on what could potentially happen next.
			Related job titles include statistician, statistical modeler,
			advanced analytics professional.
			
			Functional Analysts utilize data and leverage on derived
			insights to help organizations make better decisions on a
			specific functional domain.
			Their expertise is in business and industry domains.
			While it is still the role of Data Scientists to come up with
			prescriptive models and algorithms, the Functional Analysts, with their domain expertise, will
			be the one who will validate the insights derived by the
			Data Scientists.
			They will then make the final prescriptions to the
			leadership team enabling the leaders of the organizations
			to make better decisions.
			Related job titles include research analyst, human resource
			analyst, marketing analyst, financial analyst, operations
			analyst.
			
			Analytics Managers develop and guide data-driven projects
			– from initiation to planning, execution to performance
			monitoring, to closure.
			Their expertise is in project management.
			Analytics Managers bring the Analytics team together.
			With knowledge on what to expect from each team
			member, the Analytics Managers ensure the successful
			delivery of Analytics projects.
			
			Related job titles include chief data officer, project
			manager, data engineering manager, data science manager, analytics translator.
			It should be recognized that there are numerous Analytics
			job titles out there and that there are overlaps across these
			roles.
			
			The Analytics Association of the Philippines believes,
			however, that the job families identified here are
			differentiated enough especially in their role in the data
			value chain and in the identified areas of expertise.
			Such jobs require people with unique skills and experience
			to fill these roles.
			
			By understanding this distinction, organizations and Analytics practitioners
			can share the same set of expectations to ensure that, one,
			organizations get the most out of their Analytics efforts
			and, two, that Analytics practitioners are positively engaged
			by performing tasks that are aligned to their
			profession and career path.

			- Analytics Manager

	- 1.3.5 Watch: Decision Support Systems

			As we proceed to come to a shared definition of Analytics,
			let’s look at a definition of Analytics that states that
			Analytics is “a decision support system”.
			
			We still elect to use this term – decision support – because
			while Analytics can provide the end user with data, information, insights,
			and prescribed actions, we should maintain that the end
			user can still choose to act upon them or not.
			
			The final decision is still with the end user.
			
			With fear spreading about how digital technologies such as
			artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, and the
			like will take over our jobs, this is important to emphasize.
			
			Analytics can only provide decision support.
			We, the end user, will still have the final say.
			
			What we are adding to this definition, however, is that, in
			this digital age, Analytics provides decision support not
			only to humans within an organization, but also to digital
			processes.
			
			Analytics is also about the provisioning of data,
			information, and insights to drive digitalized processes in
			an intelligent way.
			
			Smart appliances, self-driving cars, manufacturing robots have digital processes
			that are supported by Analytics.

	- 1.3.6 Watch: Analytics Defined

			With this understanding of the data value chain, the major job families, and decision
			support systems, the following definition of Analytics is derived:
			
			Analytics progresses data along its value chain, with the purpose of delivering the
			right decision support to the right people and digital processes at the right time . . . for
			the greater good.
			
			In this definition, we note the work that Analytics is expected to perform, and the
			recipients of its output.
			
			More importantly, while Analytics – and other technologies and disciplines, for that
			matter – is, in itself, amoral, the definition emphasizes the ethical use of Analytics.

- 1.5 In a Nutshell

			That’s all for Week 1: Analytics, the Data Value Chain,
			and the Analytics Roles.
			
			Here are our key take-away points from this week:
			
			● Analytics mines and refines data to extract its value
			as it transforms data to information, to insights, and
			to imperatives.
			
			● This transformation is performed through the
			various Analytics roles: data steward, data engineer,
			data scientist, functional analyst, and analytics manager.
			It is important that the right people are assigned to the right roles.
			
			● Analytics is still just a decision support system that
			enables us, the end user, to make the final ethical
			decision on what the data is telling us.
			In Week 2, we will be discussing the Analytics
			Competencies and the Professional Maturity Model.
			We will then see the skills needed to perform
			the roles that we have defined in this week.
			Thank you for completing Week 1 and see you in Week 2.
