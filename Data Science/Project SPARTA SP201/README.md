Project SPARTA is aka Smarter Philippines through Data Analytics R&D, Training and Adoption 

Project SPARTA is an initiative made possible by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and DOST-PCIEERD in partnership with the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) and its cooperating agencies Analytics Association of the Philippines (AAP) and Coursebank (CB). 
The project was launched in order to put in place the necessary online education, research and development mechanisms and infrastructure to not only enable the industry of data science and analytics but also to advance smart governance practices.
Specifically it aims to train and graduate 30,000 learners in data science, analytics, and related fields through online learning. 

Foster a community of data science and analytics practitioners through engagement activities such as conferences, hackathons and online data challenges through the project's Smart Governance Portal.
